# Linear-Regression-Model 

This program consists of four sections. Main objective is to predict price of a car after training ML model through the given datasset.

## Part 1: Data Loading and Preprocessing
The data did not have any null values. For better data processing, car names were replaced by brand names. Some corrections have been done regarding brand names (mispelled names and short forms). Data has been scaled to mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1

## Part 2: Linear Regression Model from Scratch
Linear regression model has been implemented from scratch, without use of scikit-learn library. Multiple variables have been considered in the model to predict the final price of a car.

## Part 3: Weights of different features
Through iteration, the model is able to find the weighted importance each feature has over predicting the final price. This section plots a bar chart showing the weights of different features. Features have low correlation with the price have lower weights.

## Part 4: Sample car price prediction
This section illustrates an example of how the model predicts price of a car provided input parameters.
